# Data_Science_Projects
There are couple of projects that I have learned through many many sources from class, internet and online tutorials
I am using some of databases that are available online. I will try to acknowledge parties/individuals who have actually formed. 
I will also try to refer source of my analyses know-how. However; I may not be able to mention all. Some of those who have helped me in person or through online. I should acknowledge great contribution of Derek Kane and his Youtube channel, others are udemy, DataQuest, Data Camp. I have not used any of their database or direct project as they have paid content. I would use algorithm and analysis techniques I learnt from them. For free online sources, special thanks to Telusko, Metrum institute, Siraj Raval,CrashCourse statistics,Jordan Kern, Doc Thompson, Sentdex, Data School, DataDash and many generous contributors.
I owe you all. These projects are an attempt to explain data science concepts in a simple and easier way.They are not tutorials by any means.I only wish to share so that I could share my hard-learnt lessons to others.
Cheers
