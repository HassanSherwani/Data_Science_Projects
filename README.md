# Data_Science_Projects
There are couple of projects that I have learned through many many sources from class, internet and online tutorials.<br>
I am using databases for analysis that are available online. I will try to acknowledge parties/individuals who have actually collected data. 
I will also try to refer source of my knowledge. However; I may not be able to mention all. Some of them are who have helped me in person or through online. I should acknowledge great contribution of Derek Kane and his Youtube channel.Others learning sources are udemy, DataQuest, Data Camp. I have not used any of their database or direct project as they do not offer all free contents.I pay my special gratitude to free online sources including Telusko, Metrum institute, Siraj Raval,CrashCourse statistics,Jordan Kern, Doc Thompson, Sentdex, Data School, DataDash and many generous contributors.
I owe you all. These projects are an attempt to explain data science concepts in a simple and easier way.They are not tutorials by any means.I only wish to share so that I could share my hard-learnt lessons to others.
Cheers
