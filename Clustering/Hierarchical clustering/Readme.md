# Hierarchical clustering
is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other. <br>

Hierarchical clustering algorithms are either top-down or bottom-up. ... Bottom-up hierarchical clustering is therefore called hierarchical agglomerative clustering or HAC . Top-down clustering requires a method for splitting a cluster. It proceeds by splitting clusters recursively until individual documents are reached.


# Churn Problem
Customer churn is a costly toll on businesses. It’s not simply the lost revenue to consider, but also the added marketing expenses needed to rectify the loss. Retaining customers has historically been a lagging business indicator—it’s only after businesses lost customers that they could assess what went wrong—but with increasing access to data, several companies have developed predictive churn analysis capabilities to identify at-risk customers and proactively prevent them from leaving.
