# Gender Classification

This is the code for the gender classification challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #1' by @Sirajology on YouTube. The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body metrics (height and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.


# Challenge


Find 3 more classifiers from the sci-kit learn documentation and add them to the demo.py code. Train them on the same dataset and compare their results. You can determine accuracy by trying to predict testing you trained classifier on samples from the training data and see if it correctly classifies it.
