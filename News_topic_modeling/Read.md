# Topic Modeling

A process to automatically identify topics present in a text object and to derive hidden patterns exhibited by a text corpus. Thus, assisting better decision making.

# Dataset

Data taken from random news and categorizing them according to their respective topics.

# Method-Latent Dirichlet Allocation

LDA assumes documents are produced from a mixture of topics. Those topics then generate words based on their probability distribution. Given a dataset of documents, LDA backtracks and tries to figure out what topics would create those documents in the first place.
