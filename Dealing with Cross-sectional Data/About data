I have taken this data from Kaggle challenges.Originally, This dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset<br>
available from Luís Torgo's page (University of Porto). Luís Torgo obtained it from the StatLib repository (which is closed now).<br>
This is the dataset used in this book: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/tree/master/datasets/housing to illustrate a sample<br>
end-to-end ML project workflow (pipeline). <br>

The data is based on California Census in 1990.<br>
