# Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is a powerful statistical method that allows you to examine the relationship between two or more variables of interest. While there are many types of regression analysis, at their core they all examine the influence of one or more independent variables(x) on a dependent variable(y).<br>
**Dependent Variable:** This is the main factor that youâ€™re trying to understand or predict. <br>
**Independent Variables:** These are the factors that you hypothesize have an impact on your dependent variable. <br>


# Dataset

It is small database showing number of years and salary. We need to find how number of years effect salary level. It is expected to have a linear relationship between the two i.e if number of years increase then expected salary will also increase.<br>
